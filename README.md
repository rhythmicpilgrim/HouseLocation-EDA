# HouseLocation-EDA
This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a popular Sales Dataset and creating visualizations based on the insights gathered from the analysis. The main goal of the project is to gain a better understanding of the dataset and to communicate the findings in a visual and easily interpretable way.

# Desciption 
The California Housing dataset is a widely used dataset in machine learning and data analysis. It contains information on various features such as the median house value, median income, housing median age, and ocean proximity for different locations in California.

After performing EDA on the dataset, it was found that the median house value is positively correlated with the median income. Additionally, there seems to be a concentration of higher median house values in certain areas of California, particularly in the north. The most common ocean proximity for the housing locations is "1H OCEAN". The total number of rooms and total number of bedrooms have a positive correlation with each other, which is not surprising. There is a wide range of housing median ages in the dataset, with some locations having a housing median age as low as 1 year and others as high as 52 years.

# Insights 
After performing EDA on the dataset, some of the insights that can be derived are:

* The median house value is positively correlated with the median income, meaning areas with higher median incomes tend to have higher median house values.
* The most common ocean proximity for the housing locations is "1H OCEAN".
* There seems to be a concentration of higher median house values in certain areas of California, particularly in the north.
* The total number of rooms and total number of bedrooms have a positive correlation with each other, which is not surprising.
* There is a wide range of housing median ages in the dataset, with some locations having a housing median age as low as 1 year and others as high as 52 years.

# Conclusion 
The insights derived from the EDA on the California Housing dataset can be useful in a variety of ways. For example, it can help in predicting the median house value based on other features such as median income and ocean proximity. This can be useful for real estate companies in determining the appropriate pricing for their properties. The dataset can also help in identifying areas with higher median house values, which can be useful for urban planning and policy-making. Furthermore, the dataset can be used to analyze the effects of different factors on the median house value, such as changes in the housing median age or changes in the population. Overall, the California Housing dataset is a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring the housing market in California.
